# Investigation

Once something has a bit of meat and a leader, it can become an entry
in the Investigation column. Issues there should indicate, at a
minimum: brief abstract, what it would do if successful, who would be
interested/supportive (types of people&orgs, not individuals), and
next steps. By moving something here, a Specialist indicates intent to
lead the investigation and report back to the team. (He/she is assigned to the
relevant entry as an “owner” in the strategy funnel.)
 
Further steps in this process could include 1:1 meetings, discussion
at industry conferences, blogging/public discussion, workshops.

Onward directions include: recommend to incubate (with or without team
involvement), to evaluate for chartering because there is already
sufficient incubation, recommend to liaise elsewhere, write up and put
on hold, or actively recommend against work.
