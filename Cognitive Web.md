## Introduction

There is increasing use of AI for a wide range of applications based upon deep learning with multi-layer neural networks for classifcation and contro. These have drawbacks in requiring very large amounts of training data, and suffering from a lack transparency. This becomes an issue when AI is used for making decisions that effect people. If the decision is challenged people will demand but not receive an explanation as to why their loan request was reused, or why their insurance premum is so high. 

Symbolic representations by contrast enable explanations based upon the named relationships and inferences across them. For this reason it is interesting to explore the means to combine symbolic representations with the numerical weights featured in neural networks. The Cognitive Web is an extension of the Semantic Web that combines the Semantic Web with concepts and techniques from Cognitive Science. In particular, associating weights and time stamps with triples and nodes in RDF Graphs as a basis for cognitively plausible models of memory retrieval and rule activation, and based upon work on John R. Anderson on ACT-R.

## Architecture

The following is adopted from ACT-R by expanding ACT-R's chunks to RDF's triples.

* Cognitive Graph with a set of triples
* Conditon-Action rules
* Input and Output buffers
* Goal stacks

The weights and timestamps are updated to reflect a mathematical model of utility. This applies to both graphs and the rules that operate on them. The rule language would be based upon the shape rule language (SHRL).

## Next steps

An initial investigation in the form of a proof of concept implementation and application to selected use cases. This would be followed by the launch of a W3C incubation group to take the work further.
